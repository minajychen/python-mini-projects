the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as 
cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not 
smart enough to debug it.  -Brian W. Kernighan, computer scientist, 1942- 
DEBUGGING¥Testing a program to find errors can take 
more time than writing the code

a system that 
records changes 
to a file or set of files over time so
